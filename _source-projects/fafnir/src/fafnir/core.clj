;; Fafnir is a library that attempts to ease development of complex
;; transactions with datomic. We use a form of the state monad to
;; build up transaction "plans". These plans can be composed, and
;; commited to a Datomic connection. This entire library is immutable
;; and purely functional. No reference variables are used, and the
;; Datomic DB is only defreferenced once per commit.
