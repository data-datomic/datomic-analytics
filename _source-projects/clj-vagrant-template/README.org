* clj-vagrant-template

This Leiningen template allows you to create Vagrant-powered ready-to-hack
Clojure/Datomic applications. If you want use Vagrant in an existing project,
take a look at the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/clj-vagrant-template/tree/master/sample][sample project]] from where you can copy the files necessary
for Vagrant and Ansible.

** Installation

   You'll obviously need [[http://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]]. You will also have to install the following
   packages from your OS repositories:

   - [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]]
   - [[http://www.ansible.com/get-started][Ansible]] (used for provisioning Vagrant)

** Usage

   Create a new Clojure/Datomic project by executing:

   : lein new vagrant myproject +datomic

   You can also omit =+datomic= argument if you don't need it. Then you'll get
   an ordinary Clojure project running inside VM.

   After the project is created go inside and do:

   : vagrant up

   When run for the first time this command will take a solid while to
   complete. Here's a brief summary about what it does:

   - downloads Ubuntu 14.04 image
   - creates a new virtual machine
   - installs necessary packages (like Git and OpenJDK)
   - fetches all dependencies for the project
   - downloads and installs Datomic

   After the provisioning completes you will have a development-ready virtual
   machine where:

   - Datomic runs on 4334 inside port
   - headless REPL runs on 4242 port forwarded outside

   So you can fire up [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][CIDER]] straight away and do =M-x cider-connect localhost
   4242= to connect to the remote REPL running inside the VM (or use any other
   nREPL-compatible editor/IDE).

** Management

   Both Datomic and nREPL are run as Upstart services. In order to manipulate
   them you'll have to =vagrant ssh= inside the machine. Then you can do:

   : sudo {start/stop/restart/status} nrepl
   : sudo {start/stop/restart/status} datomic

   Restarting nREPL will prove necessary when, for example, you add new
   dependencies to your project.

   For more information on how to use Vagrant please consult its [[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/][official
   documentation]].

** Troubleshooting

*** CIDER can't connect, prints "make client process failed: connection refused"

    It is possible that nREPL hasn't yet started (especially after manual =sudo
    restart nrepl=). Try again in a few seconds.
