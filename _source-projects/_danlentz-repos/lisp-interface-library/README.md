LIL: abstract interfaces and supporting concrete data structures in Common Lisp

We wrote an article explaining about our library for ILC'2012:
	http://github.com/fare/lil-ilc2012/

A PDF of a slightly corrected version of the article is here:

An HTML	of that version of the article is here:

A short introduction on our "Interface-Passing Style" of programming, is also at:
	http://fare.livejournal.com/155094.html

Features:

* LIL sports both pure (persistent) and stateful (ephemeral) variants
 of data structures in Interface-Passing Style,
 in the respective packages PURE and STATEFUL,
 with a common core for read-only operations
 and automatic transforms to go from stateful to pure and back.

* LIL supports data structures in traditional Object-Oriented Style,
 in both stateful (the usual Object-Oriented kind) and pure variants,
 in the respective packages POSH and CLASSY,
 with automatic transforms to go from Interface-Passing Style to
 traditional Object-Oriented Style and back.
