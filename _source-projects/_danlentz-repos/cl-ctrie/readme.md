CL-CTRIE
========

**CL-CTRIE** is a common-lisp implementation of the CTrie unordered map
data-structure described in the paper '*Concurrent Tries with
Efficient Non-Blocking Snapshots*, (c) ACM 2-25-2012' by Prokopec,
Bronson, Bagwell, and Odersky.

### Overview ###

A brief overview of general ctrie
concepts and existing implementations is available through its 
[page on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctrie), of which the
following is a brief excerpt:

> The Ctrie data structure is a non-blocking
> concurrent hash array mapped trie based on
> single-word compare-and-swap instructions in a
> shared-memory system. It supports concurrent
> LOOKUP, INSERT and REMOVE operations. Just like
> the hash array mapped trie, it uses the entire
> 32-bit space for hash values thus having low
> risk of hashcode collisions... Ctries have been
> shown to be comparable in performance with
> concurrent skip lists, concurrent hash tables
> and similar data structures in terms of the
> lookup operation...  However, they are far more
> scalable than most concurrent hash tables where
> the insertions are concerned. Most concurrent
> hash tables are bad at conserving memory - when
> the keys are removed from the hash table, the
> underlying array is not [reduced in size]. Ctries
> have the property that the allocated memory is
> always a function of only the current number of
> keys in the data-structure.  Ctries have logarithmic
> complexity bounds of the basic operations...
> with a low constant factor due to [large dispersal
> ratio, (32^n arcs at level n)]. Ctries support a
> lock-free, linearizable, constant-time SNAPSHOT
> operation... This is a breakthrough in concurrent
> data-structure design, since other existing concurrent
> data-structures do not support snapshots. [This provides
> the means to support features such as] lock-free,
> linearizable iterator, size and clear operations. [This
> is superior to other] existing concurrent data-structures
> [which require the use of global locks [for exclusive,
> blocking semantics for update access] permitting...
> [no concurrent readers or writers] during any [update,
> insert, remove or other modifications]. In particular,
> Ctries have an O(1) ITERATOR creation operation, O(1)
> CLEAR operation, O(1) DUPLICATE operation and an
> amortized O(log n) operation for SIZE-RETRIEVAL.

### Platform ###

Currently the lisp platform supported by cl-ctrie is SBCL version
1.0.55 or greater hosted on x86/x86-64 architecture. Support could
easily be entended to include other common-lisp implementations that
offer atomic compare-and-swap functionality, notably LispWorks
5.x/6.x, which is also well instrumented with lock-free, atomic
primitives, although this is not necessarily a high priority for the
initial development cycle.

### Status

All tests should succeed; parallelism has been tested for 1,
2, 4, and 8 threads on an 8-core system (Dual Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
E5462 @ 2.80GHz), SBCL version 1.0.57.56-2273f3a, and Mac OS X Server
version 10.6.8.

### Ideosyncrasies

Perhaps most ideosyncrasies of this common-lisp ctrie implementation
as compared with the [original](http://github.com/axel22/Ctries),
written in Scala, result from the efforts I have taken to, where
feasible, adopt an approach emphasizing a more functional oriented
decomposition of the algortithm, written in a manner that is more
closely representative of ideomatic, common-lisp coding style.  For
example, rather than expose a general purpose GCAS and RDCSS api,
these protocols are incorporated into ctrie-specific abstractions. For
__GCAS__ the exposed api includes: `INODE-READ` `INODE-MUTATE` and
`INODE-COMMIT` and for __RDCSS:__ `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS`
`ROOT-NODE-REPLACE` and `ROOT-NODE-COMMIT.` The liberties I have taken
have the intended benefit of providing an interface that is much
easier to digest, understand, remember, and work with (at least for
me) than direct exposure in imperative style of the intricate
mechanations that underlie the ctrie algorithm.  On the other hand,
the further one strays from a direct translation of the original
(verified) ctrie implementation, the greater the likelihood of
introducing bugs into an environment (lock-free concurrent data
structure development) in which bugs can be extremely subtle and
notoriously difficult to detect.  I have attempted to strike an
appropriate balance between these conflicting concerns, and I intend
to mitigate the risk, at least in part, through continued development
of an extensive arsenal of regression tests and benchmarking
facilities.

In addition, there are a few differences in the feature set that
is provided -- such as a suite of mapping operators in leiu of a
Java-style Iterator.  For the most part I expect that these
changes will be preferable to developers accustomed to a more
'lispy' coding style.

For additional insight into the specifics unique to this ctrie
implementation, an abbreviated reference to a number of internal
details may be found in the section [Internal Reference](Internal
Reference) of this document, or, of course, by referring to
the [comprehensive documentation](doc/api/index.html) that is
provided as part of this distribution.


### Source Files

The following outline provides a general description of the
constituent source files of the cl-ctrie repository and their
respective purpose.

#### Required

The following files are the core sources currently necessary
for correct ctrie operation. 

- __`ctrie-package.lisp:`__  Package Definition
- __`ctrie.lisp:`__          Structural Implementation
- __`ctrie-util.lisp:`__     Supporting Utilities

#### Supplemental

The following files define extended functionality, management,
and analysis facilities supporting the development of CL-CTRIE.

### Performance

To date, the principal concern has been to fully achieve a working
and robust implementation of the CTRIE algorithm, with only the
occaisional profiling run from time to time in order to at least
get a general sense of where the hot-spots are and peace of mind
that there are at least no glaring bottlenecks that seem out of
hand.  A basic profiling exercise of the following activities is
reported below.

    1. construct a new ctrie instance
    2. perform one-million insertions of (fixnum) key/value pairs
    3. perform one-million lookups verifying retrieval of every value
    4. perform one-million removals verifying proper contraction of the structure
    5. verify the resulting ctrie is identical to when initially created.

### Documentation

Comprehensive, HTML based [documentation](doc/api/index.html) may be
found at the project relative pathname `doc/api/index.html`.  In order
to enable support for supplemental documentation related features, such
as the ability to dynamically regenerate the provided documentation
files incorporating all updates and changes as may be present in the
source code, a (lightly) enhanced distribution of CLDOC is required
and may be obtained on [github](http://github.com/danlentz/cldoc).

The following sections provide a compact overview of the user api
and a reference to some internal definitions of interest.

#### User API Reference

The user api of cl-ctrie should be largely familiar to the average
common-lisp programmer.  Nearly all exported symbols of the CL-CTRIE 
package begin with the prefix "ctrie" and thus can be convenientely
incorporated via USE-PACKAGE or equivalent package definition.  The
following definitions comprise a quick reference to the the public
user api:

* * * * * *


_[structure]_        `CTRIE ()`

> A CTRIE structure is the root container that uniquely identifies a CTRIE
  instance, and  contains the following perameters which specify the
  definable aspects of each CTRIE:

  - `READONLY-P` if not `NIL` prohibits any future modification or
  cloning of this instance.
  - `TEST` is a designator for an equality predicate that will be
  applied to disambiguate and determine the equality of any two
  keys. It is recommened that this value be a symbol that is fboundp,
  to retain capability of externalization (save/restore). At present,
  though, this is not enforced and a function object or lambda
  expression will also be accepted, albeit without the ability of
  save/restore.
  - `HASH` is a designator for a hash function, which may be
  desirable to customize when one has specific knowledge about the set
  of keys which will populate the table.  At this time, a 32-bit hash
  is recommended as this is what has been used for development and
  testing and has been shown to provide good performance in
  practice. As with `TEST` it is recommended that `HASH` be specified
  by a symbol that is fboundp.
  - `ROOT` is the slot used internally for storage of the root inode
  structure that maintains the reference to the contents of the ctrie
  proper.  The ctrie-root must only be accessed using the _RDCSS ROOT
  NODE PROTOCOL_ defined by the top-level entry-points `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS`
  and `ROOT-NODE-REPLACE`


_[function]_         `MAKE-CTRIE  (&REST ARGS &KEY NAME ROOT (READONLY-P NIL)
                                   (TEST 'EQUAL) (HASH 'SXHASH)
                                   &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS)`

> CREATE a new CTRIE instance. This is the entry-point constructor 
  intended for use by the end-user.


_[function]_         `CTRIE-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type ctrie.


_[function]_         `CTRIE-TEST  (CTRIE)`

> Returns the test of the specified ctrie



_[function]_         `CTRIE-HASH  (CTRIE)`

> Returns the hash of the specified ctrie



_[function]_         `CTRIE-READONLY-P  (CTRIE)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the readonly-p of the specified ctrie



_[function]_         `CTRIE-PUT  (CTRIE KEY VALUE)`

> Insert a new entry into CTRIE mapping KEY to VALUE.  If an entry
  with key equal to KEY aleady exists in CTRIE, according to the
  equality predicate defined by `CTRIE-TEST` then the priorbmapping
  will be replaced by VALUE. Returns `VALUE` representing the
  mapping in the resulting CTRIE


_[function]_         `CTRIE-GET  (CTRIE KEY)`

> Find the entry in CTRIE whose key is KEY and returns the
  associated value and T as multiple values, or returns NIL and NIL
  if there is no such entry. Entries can be added using SETF.


_[function]_         `CTRIE-DROP  (CTRIE KEY)`

> Remove KEY and it's associated value from CTRIE. Returns as multiple
  values the value associated with KEY and T if there was such an entry,
  otherewise NIL and NIL


_[macro]_            `CTRIE-DO  ((KEY VALUE CTRIE &KEY ATOMIC) &BODY BODY)`

> Iterate over the contents of CTRIE in the manner of dolist. For each
  (key . value) pair present in CTRIE, BODY (implicit PROGN) will be
  evaluated with the symbols specified for KEY and VALUE will be bound
  to the respective entry constituents.  A special variable
  ACCUM (initially NIL) is available for accumulation of a result
  value which will be returned after the completion of the CTRIE-DO
  call.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will be performed on a
  read-only atomic snapshot of CTRIE, which guarantees a consistent,
  point-in-time representation of the entries present in CTRIE.

_[function]_         `CTRIE-MAP  (CTRIE FN &KEY ATOMIC &AUX ACCUM)`

> Applies a function two arguments, FN, to each (key . value) pair present in
  CTRIE.  During the extent of CTRIE-MAP, a special variable ACCUM (initially NIL)
  is available for accumulation of a result value which will be returned after
  the completion of the CTRIE-MAP call.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will

  During the extent of CTRIE-MAP-KEYS, a special variable
  ACCUM (initially NIL) is available for accumulation of a result
  value which will be returned after the completion of the
  CTRIE-MAP-KEYS call.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will be
  performed on a read-only atomic snapshot of CTRIE, which guarantees
  a consistent, point-in-time representation of the keys present in
  CTRIE


_[function]_         `CTRIE-MAP-VALUES  (CTRIE FN &KEY ATOMIC)`

> Applies a function one argument, FN, to each value present in CTRIE.
  During the extent of CTRIE-MAP-VALUES, a special variable
  ACCUM (initially NIL) is available for accumulation of a result
  value which will be returned after the completion of the
  CTRIE-MAP-VALUES call.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will be
  performed on a read-only atomic snapshot of CTRIE, which guarantees
  a consistent, point-in-time representation of the values present in
  CTRIE


_[function]_         `CTRIE-KEYS  (CTRIE &KEY ATOMIC)`

> Construct and return a list containing all keys present in CTRIE.

  point-in-time representation of the values present in CTRIE


_[function]_         `CTRIE-SIZE  (CTRIE &KEY ATOMIC &AUX (ACCUM 0))`

> Return the number of entries present in CTRIE.  If ATOMIC is non-NIL,
  the operation will be performed on a read-only atomic snapshot of CTRIE,
  which guarantees a consistent, point-in-time representation of CTRIE


_[function]_         `CTRIE-CLEAR  (CTRIE)`

> Atomically clear all entries stored in CTRIE, returning it to a condition
  which returns `T` when tested with predicate `CTRIE-EMPTY-P`


_[function]_         `CTRIE-PPRINT  (CTRIE &OPTIONAL (STREAM T))`

> Pretty-print a representation of CTRIE as an alist containing
  all (key . value) pairs found in it.  Atomicity is not guaranteed


_[function]_         `CTRIE-TO-ALIST  (CTRIE &KEY ATOMIC)`

> Return an alist containing all (key . value) pairs found in CTRIE.
  If ATOMIC is non-NIL, the operation will be performed on a read-only
  atomic snapshot of CTRIE, which guarantees a consistent,
  point-in-time representation of the entries in CTRIE

_[function]_         `CTRIE-FROM-HASHTABLE  (HASH-TABLE &KEY CTRIE)`

> Return a CTRIE containing all (key . value) pairs found in HASH-TABLE.
  If CTRIE is specified, it will be used as the destination ctrie.
  Otherwise, a new ctrie will be created with test identical to that
  of HASH-TABLE. The hash-function will NOT be preserved, as that
  information does not appear to be recoverable from a hash-table once
  created


_[function]_         `CTRIE-FROM-ALIST  (ALIST &KEY CTRIE)`

> Return a CTRIE containing all (key . value) pairs found in ALIST.

  Otherwise, a new ctrie will be created. Atomicity is not guaranteed


_[function]_         `CTRIE-EMPTY-P  (CTRIE)`

> Return T if CTRIE contains no entries, otherwise NIL. This function is
  O(1) and is much more efficient than testing for `CTRIE-SIZE` of 0


_[function]_         `CTRIE-MAX-DEPTH  (THING)`

> Compute the maximum length of any arc. Useful as a diagnostic


_[function]_         `CTRIE-MIN-DEPTH  (THING)`

  content of the original CTRIE.  If READ-ONLY is NIL (the default),
  the new CTRIE will be a READABLE/WRITABLE 'fork' of CTRIE (see
  `CTRIE-FORK`) otherwise, the clone will be READABLE only, which has
  considerable performance benefits in some circumstances, as the arcs
  will not require `REFRESH` and should be the preferred mode when
  updates (writability) of the clone are not required


_[function]_         `CTRIE-FORK  (CTRIE)`

_[generic-function]_ `CTRIE-LAMBDA-CTRIE  (CTRIE-LAMBDA-OBJECT)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the ctrie of the specified ctrie-lambda-object



_[function]_         `CTRIE-LAMBDA-SPAWN  (SELF &KEY READ-ONLY)`

> Causes the atomic clone of enclosed ctrie structure and builds a new
  lexical closure to operate on it.  Does not bother to reproduce fancy
  (expensive) object, class, bindings, but provides almost identical
  functionality.  May be used to more efficintly distribute workload
  in parallel


_[macro]_            `DEFINE-CTRIE  (NAME CTRIE &REST ARGS &KEY (OBJECT T) SPEC)`

> Define a 'functional' __CTRIE-LAMBDA__ that combines all the the
  capabilities of the raw data structure with behavior and semantics
  one would expect of any other ordinary common-lisp function.  The
  resulting symbol defined as 'name will be bound in three distinct
  namespaces: the `SYMBOL-VALUE` will be bound to the LAMBDA CLOSURE
  object, `SYMBOL-FUNCTION` (fdefinition) will be FBOUND to the
  compiled function, and the corresponding '(SETF NAME) form will be
  SETF-BOUND.  the syntax for invoking NAME is as in a LISP1; i.e., no
  'funcall' is required (but still works if you prefer).
  Calling `(NAME key)` returns the value mapped to key, or `NIL` just
  as if by `(CTRIE-GET ctrie-name key).` Analogously when used as a
  setf-able place such as by `(setf (NAME key) value)` it has the
  equivalent behavior to the operation `(CTRIE-PUT ctrie-name key
  value).` Use of this type of binding technique has some really
  convenient effects that I've quickly started to become quite fond
  of.  One such idiom, for example, `(mapcar MY-CTRIE '(key1 key2 key3
  key4 ...))` returns a list containing all the mapped values
  corresponding to the respective keys.  One additional feature that
  I've found extremely useful is included _under the hood:_ Invoking
  MY-CTRIE on an object of type FUNCTION will not search the ctrie for
  an entry having that function ast its key, but will instead APPLY
  that function to the actual CTRIE structure wrapped within the
  closure.  Thus, `(MY-CTRIE #'identity)` will return the underlying
  ctrie as just an ordinary instance of a CTRIE STRUCTURE.  
  There are many other functions this is handy with, like
  `(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-size)` `(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-to-hashtable)`
  etc.  Some additional examples are provided below.

#### Internal Reference (abridged)

The following reference describes some selected internal
implementation details of interest.  Under normal circumstances it
should not be necessary to interact with these unexported symbols
unless developing an extension to cl-ctrie, but are presented here for
the sake of convenience, in order to provide better insight into the ctrie
structure in general, and to help illuminate significant aspects of this
implementation in particular.  As mentioned above, [comprehensive
documentation](doc/api/index.html) of all symbols is also provided,
and should be considered the authoratative reference to the CL-CTRIE
implementation.

* * * * * * *


_[special-variable]_ `*CTRIE*  (NIL)`

> Within the dynamic extent of a CTRIE operation this variable will
  be bound to the root-container CTRIE operand.  It is an error if an
  operation is defined that attempts access to a CTRIE without this
  binding, which is properly established by wrapping the operation in
  an appropriate WITH-CTRIE form.


_[special-variable]_ `*RETRIES*  (16)`

> Establishes the number of restarts permitted to a CTRIE operation
  established by a WITH-CTRIE form before a condition of type
  CTRIE-OPERATION-RETRIES-EXCEEDED will be signaled, aborting the
  operatation, and requiring operator intervention to resume
  processing.


_[special-variable]_ `*TIMEOUT*  (2)`

> Establishes the duration (in seconds) allotted to a CTRIE operation
  established by a WITH-CTRIE form before a condition of type
  CTRIE-OPERATION-TIMEOUT-EXCEEDED will be signaled, aborting the
  operatation, and requiring operator intervention to resume
  processing.


_[special-variable]_ `*HASH-CODE*  (NIL)`

> Special variable used to store the hash-code that corresponds to the
  current operation.  Used as a means of improving efficiency by eliminating
  needless recomputation of the hash function, which is the most expensive
  part of most user-level ctrie operations.  If this value is not set, then
  the hash will simply be computed on demand and processing will continue
  unaffected.  Use of this variable is simply an optional performace
  optimization techniqie.


_[macro]_            `MULTI-CATCH  (TAG-LIST &BODY FORMS)`

> Macro allowing catch of multiple tags at once and
    finding out which tag was thrown.
    * RETURNS: (values RESULT TAG)
       -  RESULT is either the result of evaluationg FORMS or the value
          thrown by the throw form.
       -  TAG is NIl if evaluation of the FORMS completed normally
          or the tag thrown and cought.
    * EXAMPLE:
    ```
        ;;; (multiple-value-bind (result tag)
        ;;;            (multi-catch (:a :b)
        ;;;                 ...FORMS...)
        ;;;              (case tag 
        ;;;                 (:a ...)
        ;;;                 (:b ...)
        ;;;                 (t ...)))
    ```


_[macro]_            `CATCH-CASE  (FORM &REST CASES)`

> User api encapsulating the MULTI-CATCH control-structure in a
    syntactic format that is identical to that of the familiar CASE
    statement, with the addition that within the scope of each CASE
    clause, a lexical binding is established between the symbol IT and
    the value caught from the throw form.


_[structure]_        `CTRIE ()`

> A CTRIE structure is the root container that uniquely identifies a CTRIE
  instance, and  contains the following perameters which specify the
  definable aspects of each CTRIE:

  - `READONLY-P` if not `NIL` prohibits any future modification or
  cloning of this instance.
  - `TEST` is a designator for an equality predicate that will be
  applied to disambiguate and determine the equality of any two
  keys. It is recommened that this value be a symbol that is fboundp,
  to retain capability of externalization (save/restore). At present,
  though, this is not enforced and a function object or lambda
  expression will also be accepted, albeit without the ability of
  save/restore.
  - `HASH` is a designator for a hash function, which may be
  desirable to customize when one has specific knowledge about the set
  of keys which will populate the table.  At this time, a 32-bit hash
  is recommended as this is what has been used for development and
  testing and has been shown to provide good performance in
  practice. As with `TEST` it is recommended that `HASH` be specified
  by a symbol that is fboundp.
  - `ROOT` is the slot used internally for storage of the root inode
  structure that maintains the reference to the contents of the ctrie
  proper.  The ctrie-root must only be accessed using the _RDCSS ROOT
  NODE PROTOCOL_ defined by the top-level entry-points `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS`
  and `ROOT-NODE-REPLACE`


_[function]_         `CTRIE-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type ctrie.


_[function]_         `CTRIE-HASH  (CTRIE)`

> Returns the hash of the specified ctrie



_[function]_         `CTRIE-TEST  (CTRIE)`

> Returns the test of the specified ctrie



_[function]_         `CTRIE-READONLY-P  (CTRIE)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the readonly-p of the specified ctrie



_[function]_         `CTHASH  (KEY)`

> Compute the hash value of KEY using the hash function defined by
  the CTRIE designated by the innermost enclosing WITH-CTRIE form.


_[function]_         `CTEQUAL  (X Y)`

> Test the equality of X and Y using the equality predicate defined
  by the CTRIE designated by the innermost enclosing WITH-CTRIE form.


_[macro]_            `WITH-CTRIE  (&ONCE CTRIE &BODY BODY)`

> Configure the dynamic environment with the appropriate condition
  handlers, control fixtures, and instrumentation necessary to execute
  the operations in BODY on the specified CTRIE. Unless specifically
  documented, the particular configuration of this dynamic environment
  should be considered an implementation detail and not relied upon. A
  particular exception, however, is that within the dynamic extent of
  a WITH-CTRIE form, the code implementing a CTRIE operation may
  expect that the special variable `*CTRIE*` will be bound to the root
  container of subject CTRIE.  See also the documentation for
  `*CTRIE*`


_[function]_         `FLAG  (KEY LEVEL &OPTIONAL USE-CACHED-P)`

> For a given depth, LEVEL, within a CTRIE, extract the correspondant
  sequence of bits from the computed hash of KEY that indicate the
  logical index of the arc on the path to which that key may be found.
  If USE-CACHED-P is non-NIL and the special-variable `*HASH-CODE*` is
  non-NIL as well, the hash will not be recomputed, but instead the
  value bound to `*HASH-CODE*` will be used as an optimization to
  reduce unnecessary recomputation of hash function -- an expensive
  operation.  This value is NOT checked and assumed to be valid and
  appropriate to the given situation -- care must be taken to use this
  cached value correctly.  When in doubt, recomputing hash may be a
  performance penalty, but is guaranteed to always work in any
  situation.  Note that the logical index of the arc is most likely
  not the same as the physical index where it is actually located --
  for that see `FLAG-ARC-POSITION`


_[function]_         `FLAG-PRESENT-P  (FLAG BITMAP)`

> Tests the (fixnum) BITMAP representing the logical index of all
  arcs present in a CNODE for the presence of a particular arc whose
  logical index is represented by FLAG.


_[function]_         `FLAG-ARC-POSITION  (FLAG BITMAP)`

> Given FLAG representing the logical index of an arc, and BITMAP
  representing all arcs present, compute a physical index for FLAG in
  such a manner as to always ensure all arcs map uniquely and
  contiguously to the smallest vector that can contain the given
  arcs.


_[function]_         `FLAG-VECTOR  (&OPTIONAL (CONTENT 0))`

> FLAG-VECTOR is a bit-vector representation of the (fixnum)
  BITMAP. It is currently not used for any calculation, however it is
  included within each CNODE as a convenience because it makes it
  immediately clear from visual inspection which logical arc indexes
  are represented in the node. For example, from the bit-vector
  `#*10010000000000000000000000000000` one can easily see that the first
  and fourth positions are occupied, and the rest empty.


_[structure]_        `REF ()`

> Atomically Stamped Reference structure _[Herlithy, TAOMP]_ that
  encapsulates the mutable slots within an inode. Any specific `REF`
  structure is, itself, never mutated.  Using the `REF` structure
  as basis of inode implementation provides the capability to 'bundle'
  additional metadata in an inode while still providing atomic compare
  and swap using a single comparison of the aggregate `REF` instance.
   - `STAMP` defines a slot containing implementation-specific metadata
     that may be maintained internally as a means of tracking inode
     modification and update behavior.  It should not be referenced by
     user code, and the format of its contents should not be relied apon.
   - `VALUE` defines a slot that contains a reference to the MAIN-NODE
     that the enclosing inode should be interpreted as 'pointing to'
   - `PREV` defines a slot which, during the `INODE-COMMIT` phase of the
     _GCAS INODE PROTOCOL_ maintains a reference to the last valid
     inode state, which may be restored, if necessary, during the
     course of the `INODE-READ` / `INODE-COMMIT` arbitration process


_[function]_         `REF-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type ref.


_[function]_         `REF-STAMP  (REF)`

> Returns the stamp of the specified ref



_[function]_         `REF-VALUE  (REF)`

> Returns the value of the specified ref



_[function]_         `REF-PREV  (REF)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the prev of the specified ref



_[structure]_        `FAILED-REF (REF)`

> A `FAILED-REF` is a structure that is used to preserve the linkage to
  prior inode state following a failed GCAS.  Any inode access that
  detects a `FAILED-REF` will immediately invoke a commit to restore the
  inode to the state recorded in `FAILED-REF-PREV`


_[function]_         `FAILED-REF-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type failed-ref.


_[type]_             `LEAF-NODE  NIL`

> A LEAF-NODE represents a terminal value in a CTRIE arc.
  LEAF-NODEs always contain a unit-payload of CTRIE data
  storage; For example, an SNODE contains a key/value pair.


_[type]_             `BRANCH-NODE  NIL`

> a BRANCH-NODE represents a single arc typically contained
  within A CNODE.


_[type]_             `MAIN-NODE  NIL`

> A MAIN-NODE is a node that typically represents a specific
  depth or level within the ctrie and is referenced
  by its own unique inode.


_[structure]_        `INODE ()`

> An INODE, or 'Indirection Node' is the mutable structure
  representing the link between other 'main-node' structures found in
  a ctrie.  An inode is the only type of node that may change the
  value of its content during its lifetime.  In this implementation,
  all such values as may change are encapsulated within a `REF`
  substructure.  Each inode also contains a generational descriptor
  object, comparible by identity only, which is used to identify the
  state of synchronization between the inode and the current
  'generation' indicated by the root inode at the base of the
  CTRIE. As an inode may not change its 'gen identity' during its
  lifetime, this disparity with the generation of the root node will
  immediately result in the replacement of the inode with a new one
  properly synchronized with the root's `GEN` object. In this
  implementation, `GEN` objects are implemented by GENSYMS -- unique,
  uninterned symbols which inherently provide very similar symantics
  to those required of the generational descriptor.
  - `GEN` defines a slot containing a generational descriptor object
  - `REF` defines a slot containing a `REF` struct that encapsulates
    the mutable content within an INODE


_[function]_         `INODE-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type inode.


_[function]_         `INODE-GEN  (INODE)`

> Returns the gen of the specified inode



_[function]_         `INODE-REF  (INODE)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the ref of the specified inode



_[function]_         `MAKE-INODE  (LINK-TO &OPTIONAL GEN STAMP PREV)`

> Construct a new INODE that represents a reference to the value
  provided by argument LINK-TO, optionally augmented with a specified
  generational descriptor, timestamp, and/or previous state


_[macro]_            `GCAS-COMPARE-AND-SET  (OBJ EXPECTED NEW EXPECTED-STAMP
                                             NEW-STAMP PREV)`

> A thin, macro layer abstraction over the basic compare-and-swap
  primitive which provides a consistent interface to the underlying
  inode structure and manages additional metadata, providing
  reasonable defaults when they are not specified.


_[function]_         `INODE-READ  (INODE)`

> INODE-READ provides the top-level interface to the inode _GCAS ACCESS_
  api, which is the mechanism which must be used to gain access to the
  content of any NON-ROOT inode. For access to the root inode, refer
  to the RDCSS inode api `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS`. Returns as four values,
  the MAIN-NODE, the STAMP, the PREVIOUS STATE (if any), and the REF
  structure encapsulated by the inode.


_[function]_         `INODE-MUTATE  (INODE OLD-VALUE NEW-VALUE)`

> INODE-MUTATE provides the top-level interface to the inode _GCAS
  MODIFICATION_ api, which is the mechanism which must be used to
  effect any change in a NON-ROOT inode.  For modification of the
  root-inode, refer to the `ROOT-NODE-REPLACE` _RDCSS ROOT NODE
  PROTOCOL_ Returns a boolean value which indicates the success or
  failure of the modification attempt.


_[function]_         `INODE-COMMIT  (INODE REF)`

> INODE-COMMIT implements the _GCAS COMMIT_ protocol which is invoked
  as necessary by the `INODE-READ` and `INODE-MUTATE` entry-points.  It is
  not meant to be invoked directly, as this would most likely result
  in corruption. Returns the `REF` structure representing the content of
  whatever root inode wound up successfully committed -- either the
  one requested, or one represented by a previous valid state.  In order
  to coexist with the _RDCSS ROOT NODE PROTOCOL_ this GCAS COMMIT
  implementation is augmented with RDCSS ABORTABLE READ semantics
  by a forward reference to a RDCSS-aware `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS` in order
  to safely compare INODE's generational descriptor with the one found
  in the root inode of the subject CTRIE.


_[function]_         `SNODE  (KEY VALUE)`

> Construct a new SNODE which represents the mapping from
  domain-element KEY to range-element VALUE.


_[structure]_        `SNODE ()`

> SNODE, i.e., 'Storage Node', is the LEAF-NODE structure ultimately
  used for the storage of each key/value pair contained in the CTRIE.
  An SNODE is considered to be immutable during its lifetime.
   - `KEY` defines the slot containing an element of the map's domain.
   - `VALUE` defines the slot containing the range-element mapped to `KEY`


_[function]_         `SNODE-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type snode.


_[function]_         `SNODE-KEY  (SNODE)`

> Returns the key of the specified snode



_[function]_         `SNODE-VALUE  (SNODE)`

> Returns the value of the specified snode



_[structure]_        `LNODE ()`

> LNODE, i.e., 'List Node', is a special structure used to enclose
  SNODES in a singly-linked chain when the hash-codes of the
  respective SNODE-KEYS collide, but those keys are determined to be
  unique by the `CTRIE-TEST` function defined for that ctrie.  An
  LNODE (and therefore a chain of LNODEs) is considered to be
  immutable during its lifetime.  The order of the list is

  Any time a TNODE is encountered during the course of a `CTRIE-GET` (`%lookup`)
  operation, the operative thread is required to invoke a `CLEAN` operation
  on the TNODE it has encountered and throw to `:RESTART` its lookup activity
  over again.  A TNODE is considered to be immutable and may not change its
  value during its lifetime.

_[structure]_        `CNODE ()`

> A CNODE, or 'Ctrie Node' is a MAIN-NODE containing a vector of up
  to `2^W` 'arcs' -- i.e., references to either an SNODE or INODE
  structure, collectively referred to as `BRANCH-NODES.` Each CNODE
  also contains a (fixnum) bitmap that describes the layout of which
  logical indices within the total capacity of `2^W` arcs are actually
  allocated within that node with BRANCH-NODES physically present.
  For more specific details on these BITMAP and ARC-VECTOR
  constituents, refer to the following related functions: `FLAG`
  `FLAG-PRESENT-P` `FLAG-VECTOR` and `FLAG-ARC-POSITION. The CNODE
  structure is considered to be immutable and arcs may not be added or
  removed during its lifetime.  The storage allocated within a CNODE
  is fixed and specified at the time of its creation based on the
  value of BITMAP during initialization
   - `BITMAP`
   - `ARCS` 


_[function]_         `CNODE-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns T if the specified object is of type cnode.


_[function]_         `MAKE-CNODE  (&OPTIONAL (BITMAP 0))`

> Construct a CNODE with internal storage allocated for the number of
  arcs equal to the Hamming-Weight of the supplied BITMAP parameter.
  If no BITMAP is provided, the CNODE created will be empty -- a state
  which is only valid for the level 0 node referenced by the root of
  the CTRIE.  This constructor is otherwise never called directly, but
  is invoked during the course of higher-level operations such as
  `CNODE-EXTENDED` `CNODE-UPDATED` `CNODE-TRUNCATED` and `MAP-CNODE`


_[function]_         `CNODE-EXTENDED  (CNODE FLAG POSITION NEW-ARC)`

> Construct a new cnode structure that is exactly like CNODE, but
  additionally contains the BRANCH-NODE specified by parameter NEW-ARC
  and logical index FLAG at the physical index POSITION within its
  vector of allocated arcs.  The BITMAP of this new CNODE will be
  calculated as an adjustment of the prior CNODE's BITMAP to reflect
  the presence of this additional arc.  In addition, the physical
  index within the extended storage vector for the other arcs present
  may also change with respect to where they were located in the prior
  CNODE.  In other words, the physical index of a given arc within the
  compressed CNODE storage vector should never be relied upon
  directly, it should always be accessed by calculation based on its
  LOGICAL index and the current CNODE BITMAP as described in more
  detail by the documentation for the functions `FLAG` `FLAG-VECTOR` and
  `FLAG-ARC-POSITION`


_[function]_         `CNODE-UPDATED  (CNODE POSITION REPLACEMENT-ARC)`

> Construct a new cnode structure identical to CNODE, but having the
  BRANCH-NODE physically located at POSITION within the storage
  vector replaced by the one specified by REPLACEMENT-ARC.  Unlike
  `CNODE-EXTENDED` and `CNODE-TRUNCATED` the allocated storage and
  existing BITMAP of this CNODE will remain unchanged (as this is
  simply a one-for-one replacement) and correspondingly, no reordering
  of other nodes within the storage vector will occur


_[function]_         `CNODE-TRUNCATED  (CNODE FLAG POS)`

> Construct a new cnode structure that is exactly like CNODE, but
 with the arc at logical index FLAG and physical storage vector
 location POS removed.  The new CNODE will have an updated bitmap
 value that is adusted to reflect the removal of this arc, and the
 position of other arcs within the storage vector of the new CNODE
 will be adjusted in a manner analogous to that of `CNODE-EXTENDED`
 More details on this process may be found by referring to the
 documentation for the functions `FLAG` `FLAG-VECTOR` and
 `FLAG-ARC-POSITION`


_[function]_         `MAP-CNODE  (FN CNODE)`

> Construct a new cnode structure that is exactly like CNODE, but
  with each arc (BRANCH-NODE) present in CNODE replaced by the result
  of applying FN to that arc.  I.e., a simple functional mapping from
  the old CNODE by FN.  As with `CNODE-UPDATED` the allocated storage and
  BITMAP of the resulting CNODE will remain unchanged from the
  original, and no physical reordering of nodes within the storage
  vector will occur


_[function]_         `CNODE-CONTRACTED  (CNODE LEVEL)`

> The _CONTRACTION_ of a CNODE is an ajustment performed when a CNODE
  at depth other than level 0 contains only a single SNODE arc.  In
  such a case, that SNODE is entombed in a new TNODE, which is
  returned as the result of the CNODE contraction. In all other cases
  the CNODE is simply returned as-is.  A CONTRACTION represents the
  first of the two-step _ARC RETRACTION PROTOCOL_ that effects the reclaimation
  of allocated storage no longer used and the optimization of of lookup
  efficiency by compacting CTRIE depth and thereby the number of levels
  which must be traversed.  For further information, refer to the function
  `CNODE-COMPRESSED` which implements the second stage of this protocol,
  completing the process.


_[function]_         `CNODE-COMPRESSED  (CNODE LEVEL)`

> The _COMPRESSION_ of a CNODE is the second step of the _ARC
  RETRACTION PROTOCOL_ completing a retraction that has been initiated
  by `CNODE-CONTRACTED`.  The CNODE compression is computed by
  generating a replacement cnode structure that is similar to CNODE,
  but with any entombed inode arcs created during contraction simply
  replaced by the SNODE that had been entombed. This is called the
  _RESURRECTION_ of that SNODE. After all entombed inode arcs of a
  cnode have been collapsed into simple SNODE leaves, if the resulting
  CNODE has been compressed so far as to contain only a single SNODE
  leaf, it is subjected to another CONTRACTION before it is returned
  as the result of the compression. Otherwise it is simply returned
  and represents a complete iteration of the _ARC RETRACTION PROTOCOL_


_[function]_         `CLEAN  (INODE LEVEL)`

> CLEAN is the basic entry-point into the arc retraction protocol. Given an
  arbitrary, non-root inode referencing a CNODE that can be compressed,
  update that inode to reference the result of that compression.  Otherwise
  INODE will remain unaffected.


_[function]_         `CLEAN-PARENT  (PARENT-INODE TARGET-INODE KEY LEVEL)`

> During a `CTRIE-DROP` (`%remove`) operation, if the result of a KEY/VALUE
  removal is an arc consisting of an `ENTOMBED` inode (one referencing a TNODE), then,
  if that arc remains accessible from the parent of a CNODE containing it, generate
  the compression of that CNODE and update its parent INODE with the result.


_[structure]_        `RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR ()`

> An RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR object represents a 'plan' for a proposed RDCSS
  (restricted double compare single swap) operation. The use of this
  descriptor object provides the means to effect an atomic RDCSS in
  software, requiring only hardware support for single-word CAS, which is
  preferable because it is commonly available on curent consumer hardware.
   - `OV`        designates a slot containing the OLD (current) root inode.
                 If the swap is unsuccessful, the resulting ctrie will revert
                 to this structure as the root inode. 
   - `OVMAIN`    designates a slot containing the CNODE that is referenced
                 by the OLD (current) root inode.
   - `NV`        designates a slot containing a fully assembled replacement
                 root inode referencing a valid CNODE. This pair will become
                 the root inode and level 0 MAIN-NODE of the ctrie if the
                 swap is successful.
   - `COMMITTED` designates a flag which, when not NIL, indicates that the
                 RDCSS plan defined by this descriptor has completed
                 successfully


_[function]_         `RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR-P  (OBJECT)`

> Returns the nv of the specified rdcss-descriptor



_[function]_         `RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR-COMMITTED  (RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the committed of the specified rdcss-descriptor



_[function]_         `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS  (CTRIE &OPTIONAL ABORT)`

> ROOT-NODE-ACCESS extends `FIND-CTRIE-ROOT`,
  implementing the _RDCSS ROOT NODE PROTOCOL_ for access to root inode of
  CTRIE.  In particular, it ensures that if, instead of an inode, the
  root of CTRIE contains an RDCSS descriptor of a proposed root-node
  update, that it will immediately invoke `ROOT-NODE-COMMIT` to act
  on that descriptor and return an INODE struct that is the result of
  the completed commit process. `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS` only provides access
  to the root inode _STRUCTURE_ and in particular it does not provide
  safe access to the _CONTENT_ of that inode. In order to access those
  contents, the root inode returned by `ROOT-NODE-ACCESS` must be further
  processed by `INODE-READ` in order to still properly comply with the
  underlying GCAS protocol implementation requirements common to all
  inodes


_[function]_         `ROOT-NODE-REPLACE  (CTRIE OV OVMAIN NV)`

> ROOT-NODE-REPLACE implements the _RDCSS ROOT NODE PROTOCOL_ for
  replacement of the ROOT INODE of a CTRIE structure with another one
  that contains new or alternative values, achieving the end-result
  effectively the same as if by mutation.  The replacement of the root
  inode is accomplished in two, basic conceptual stages. First, an
  `RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR` object which specifies in full the current state
  and all desired changes in the proposed resulting state.  Thus,
  whether any individual replacement attempt succeeds or fails, either
  result is guarenteed to represent a valid state. An attempt is then
  made to atomically swap this RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR with the current CTRIE
  root inode.  Note that, although it contains all of the information
  representing two, distinct, root inode states, the RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR
  is not, itself, a valid root inode.  That is the reason why all
  access to the root inode must be accomplished using this specialized
  _RDCSS ROOT NODE PROTOCOL_ rather than just the _GCAS INODE
  PROTOCOL_ alone, as is done with all other non-root inodes.  Once an
  atomic compare-and-swap of an RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR object with the root
  inode completes successfully, `ROOT-NODE-COMMIT` is invoked which
  will attempt to complete the second step of this protocol.  The
  result of that commit will be one or the other of the two valid
  states defined in the RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR object.  If another thread
  concurrently attempts access to a root node holding an
  RDCSS-DESCRIPTOR object rather than an INODE, it will invoke
  `ROOT-NODE-COMMIT` itself, possibly prempting our own attempt, but
  guaranteeing nonblocking access to a valid root node by any concurrent
  thread


_[function]_         `ROOT-NODE-COMMIT  (CTRIE &OPTIONAL ABORT)`

> rdcss api to complete a root-node transaction


_[function]_         `CTRIE-SNAPSHOT  (CTRIE &KEY READ-ONLY)`

> Atomically create a clone of CTRIE that may be operated upon
  independently without affecting or being affected by operations or
  content of the original CTRIE.  If READ-ONLY is NIL (the default),
  the new CTRIE will be a READABLE/WRITABLE 'fork' of CTRIE (see
  `CTRIE-FORK`) otherwise, the clone will be READABLE only, which has
  considerable performance benefits in some circumstances, as the arcs
  will not require `REFRESH` and should be the preferred mode when
  updates (writability) of the clone are not required


_[function]_         `CTRIE-CLEAR  (CTRIE)`

> Atomically clear all entries stored in CTRIE, returning it to a condition
  which returns `T` when tested with predicate `CTRIE-EMPTY-P`


_[function]_         `CTRIE-PUT  (CTRIE KEY VALUE)`

> Insert a new entry into CTRIE mapping KEY to VALUE.  If an entry
  with key equal to KEY aleady exists in CTRIE, according to the
  equality predicate defined by `CTRIE-TEST` then the priorbmapping
  will be replaced by VALUE. Returns `VALUE` representing the
  mapping in the resulting CTRIE


_[function]_         `%INSERT  (INODE KEY VALUE LEVEL PARENT STARTGEN)`

>    -  The detailed specifics required to perform an insertion into a
  CTRIE map are defined by and contained within the `%INSERT` function,
  which is not part of the USER API and should never be invoked
  directly.  The procedures required for interaction with `%INSERT` are
  managed entirely by the upper layer entry-points and should be
  entirely invisible to the developer using CL-CTRIE.  The alogorithm is
  intricate and requires quite some effort to figure out based on the
  papers and documentation. For that reason this attempt is made to
  properly document the process -- not to encourage anyone to fiddle
  with it...

  > 1.  A given call to %insert carries with it no guarantee that it will
  actually succeed.  Further, there is no guarantee it will do anything
  at all -- including ever returning to the caller having invoked it.
  This is because there are a number of circumstances that may possibly
  interfere with insertion in a lock-free concurrent data-structure and
  in order to minimize the cost incurred by aborted attempts and
  restarts, there is no effort wasted on careful condition handling or
  recovery.  Instead, as soon as it is recognised that a particular
  attempt will not succeed, Control is thrown via non-local exit
  unceremoneously the entire call stack and restarting each time from
  the very beginning. There are quite a few places within the process
  where you will find these nonlocal exits. Originally I had in mind to
  incorporate some additional insrumentation to track and gather
  statistics the log the specifics of all this, and there are a number
  of extension points provided.  For more details refer to the
  `MULTI-CATCH` and `CATCH-CASE` control structure documentation.

  > 2.  %insert ALWAYS begins at an INODE.  This is not surprising, of
  course, since the root of the tree (where all inserts begin) is an
  INODE, and because INODES are the only nodes that provide
  mutability. When we which to effect change to the CTRIE regardless of
  where or what type, It may only be accomplished by mutating the parent
  INODE immediately above it to reference content that must be freshly
  regenerated each time changes are required.  Once it is established
  that the %insert always begins at an inode, we can reason further
  about the sequence of events that follow by considering some of the
  node oriented invariants for CTRIEs specified variously in the
  academic literature.  First, it has been clearly defined that an INODE
  structure may only reference three kinds of structure that we
  collectively refer to as MAIN-NODES.  These are the three potential
  cases which we will consider next.

  > 3.  Consider first the TNODE. If indeed we follow an INODE and
  discover it directly leads us to a TNODE, or 'Tomb Node'. This tells
  us, first, that we have arrived at a dead-end, second that we must
  assist with the 'compression' of this arc by invoking the `CLEAN`
  operation on the tombed INODE's parent.  Finally, there is nothing
  further we can do so we THROW to :RESTART.

  > 4.  If traverse the INODE and arrive at an LNODE, we are also at the
  end of the ARC, but if it is due to hash collision then the algorithm
  then indeed it may be correct.  In this case we attempt to 'insert'
  ourself in te LNODE chain and then invoke INODE mutate to atomic
  commit and then THROW to :RESTART

  > 5.  As a simple instance of the general case, we may arrive at a CNODE
  with vacant arc that represents the index specified by the bits of our
  KEY's hash code that are active for this level within the ctrie.  When
  this is the case, we construct a replacement CNODE augmented with our
  key/value pair as an SNODE LEAF at the physical position within the
  CNODES storage vector appropriately translated from the logical arc
  index as described by the documentation of the functions
  `FLAG-ARC-POSITION` and `FLAG-VECTOR` If we successfully mutate the
  parent inode by completing an atomic replacement of the old cnode with
  the one we constructed, then our insertion has succeeded and we return
  the range value now successfully mapped by KEY in order to indicate
  our success.  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART.

  > 6.  If we find the logical index of our 'arc' in this CNODE is not
  empty and available as we did above, there are exactly two other
  possibly find there; we know this because it is required to be a
  BRANCH-NODE -- either an snode leaf storage or an inode referencing a
  MAIN-NODE that represents the next layer of the CTRIE.  We describe
  various posible cases and the define a procedure specified for each
  below.

  > 7.  If we find that the node PRESENT at this index is an INODE, then
  this is the simplest of the possible cases.  Conceptually, what we
  intend to do is continue to follow our arc, descending to the next
  level of the CTRIE structure that is referenced by that inode.  In
  practice, however, we are required to consider the possibility that
  the generational descriptor object the inode contains may not be
  consistent with STARTGEN, which is the one current in the root INODE
  of this CTRIE.  This may be the case, for example, as the result of
  some past cloning/snapshot operation if we are the first since then to
  traverse this inode. (Remember that the refresh of generational
  descriptor occurs lazily on an as-needed basis in order to avoid
  overhead incurred by eager traversals which often turn out to have
  been unnecessary).  In consideration of this we proceeed as follows: -
  If the inode generational descriptor is consistent with STARTGEN, we
  simply continue along our arc by recursively invoking `%insert` on
  that INODE.  If that function call returns successfully with a VALUE,
  then the insertion was successful, and we also then return, passing
  along that value.  Thus the result is communicated back through the
  caller chain, eventually arriving back as the result of the original
  CTRIE-PUT entry-point.  - Otherwise if the generational descriptor is
  not consistent with STARTGEN we attempt an atomic `INODE-MUTATE` on
  the PARENT INODE of this CNODE that effects the replacement of that
  inode within it by one FRESHLY CREATED by `REFRESH` and ensured to be
  consistent with STARTGEN.  If this succeeds, we invoke %insert
  recusively and proceed in the same manner, since, effectively, we are
  now in a state equivalent to the one described above.  - If the
  INODE-MUTATE of the prior step did NOT succeed, then we are out of
  options and throw to :RESTART the insertion process from the beginning
  all over again.

  > 8.  If we find that the node PRESENT at this index is an SNODE,
  then our situation becomes a little bit more complex and
  there are a few more contingencies we must be prepared to
  address.

  > 9.  Once again, looking at the simplest first, when an insert
  operation encounters a leaf-node somewhere along the descent of it's
  'own' arc, one potential case is that it found the node it was
  looking for -- one that contains a key that satisfies the test
  predicate defined for the dynamic extent of the current operation,
  `CTEQUAL,` when compared to the `KEY` currently being `%INSERTED.`
  If the equality test is satisfied then the VALUE that node maps
  should be updated with the one of the present insertion.  The steps
  to effect the update are very similar to those of step 5, however We
  construct a replacement CNODE augmented with our key/value pair as a
  replacement SNODE in the SAME physical position as the one we have
  found -- refer to the documentation for the function `CNODE-UPDATED`
  for additional specifics on the internal details that describe this
  operation.  If we successfully mutate the parent inode by completing
  an atomic replacement of the old cnode with the one we constructed,
  then our update has succeeded and we return the range value now
  successfully mapped by KEY in order to indicate our success.
  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART.

  > 10.  In some circumstances, we encounter a node on our arc whose
  hash code bits have matched that of the current key of this
  insertion for all of the lower order bits that have been consumed so
  far, up to the current depth, but that (as opposed to step 9) does
  not satisfy `CTEQUAL.` and so is NOT a candidiate for update
  replacement.  Except in very vare circumstances, there will be some
  depth at which the active bits of its hash code will indeed be
  distinct from our own, and at that point a CNODE can be constructed
  that will proprerly contain both it and an snode mapping the
  key/value of the current insertion.  This means we must ENTEND the
  ctrie as many layers as needed to get to that depth, inserting
  CNODES and INODES at each step along the way.  Now, we will first
  describe the 'edge' case where we have encounted the 'rare
  circumstance.' If we perform this process and arrive at a depth
  where all 32 hash code bits have been consumed and, indeed, these
  two unequal keys are the result of a 'hash code collision' In order
  that we preserve correct operation, we respond in this case by
  chaining these key/value SNODES into a linked list of LNODES.
  Therefore, they can share the same arc index and when we encounter
  such a thing during future traversals, we can accomodate the
  collision using simple linear search and a few basic LNODE utility
  functions such as `LNODE-INSERTED` `LNODE-REMOVED` `LNODE-SEARCH`
  `LNODE-LENGTH` and the list constructor `ENLIST.` Once we have
  `ENLIST`ed the colliding SNODES, we create a new INODE pointing to
  that list, and then attempt atomic replacement of the CNODE above
  with one we extend to contain that INODE.  If we do successfully
  mutate the prior CNODES parent INODE resulting in its replacement
  with the CNODE we constructed, then our insert has succeeded and we
  return the range value now successfully mapped by KEY in order to
  indicate our success.  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART.

  > 11.  Finally, let us return to those intermediate steps, mentioned
  above, to specify the means by which we perform the level-by-level
  extension of a given arc to accommodate both the above case of hash
  collision as well as the more common one when the reason for
  extension is simply to accomodate normal growth capacity and
  allocation.  In both cases, though, the extensions are performed for
  the same initiating cause -- to accomodate the collision of leaf
  node keys resident at lower levels of the structure.  Depending on
  the similarity of two colliding hash keys, the extension process may
  not be resolved with a single iteration.  In the case of full
  collisiion, described above, the extension process will recur, up to
  a maximum depth of `(32/W)` levels, at which point an L-NODE chain
  will be created.  At each iteration, a new INODE is created,
  pointing to a new CNODE containing one of our conflictung pairs.
  Then, `%INSERT` is attempted on that INODE and this process recurs.
  Once this cycle of insert/extend completes, each INODE/CNODE pair is
  returned to the parent -- the entire newly created structure
  eventually returning to the point of original conflicts whre the
  extension cycle began.  If we successfully mutate the parent inode
  by completing an atomic replacement of the old cnode with the one
  that begins this newly built structue, then our update has succeeded
  and we return the range value now successfully mapped by KEY in
  order to indicate our success.  Otherwise we THROW to :RESTART

_[function]_         `%LOOKUP  (INODE KEY LEVEL PARENT STARTGEN)`

> The general concept of the procedure for finding a given key within
  a simplified SEQUENTIAL model of a CTRIE can be summarized as
  follows: If the internal node is at level `L` then the W bits of the
  hashcode starting from position `W * L` are used as a logical index
  into the vector of `2^W` arcs that can possibly be represented
  within that node (see `FLAG` and `FLAG-VECTOR`). This logical index
  is then transformed into a physical index that denotes a specific
  position locating this arc relative to all other arcs currently
  present in the node (see `FLAG-ARC-POSITION`.  In this way, storage
  within the node need not be allocated for representation of empty
  arc positions. At all times the invariant is maintained that the
  number of arcs allocated within a given CNODE is equal to the
  Hamming-Weight of its BITMAP -- i.e., the number of nonzero bits
  present (see `CL:LOGCOUNT`). The arc at this calculated relative
  position is then followed, and the process repeated until arrival at
  a leaf-node or empty arc position.  Locating a given key becomes

  the new CTRIE will be a READABLE/WRITABLE 'fork' of CTRIE (see
  `CTRIE-FORK`) otherwise, the clone will be READABLE only, which has
  considerable performance benefits in some circumstances, as the arcs

_[generic-function]_ `CTRIE-LAMBDA-CTRIE  (CTRIE-LAMBDA-OBJECT)`

> Returns and (with setf) changes the ctrie of the specified ctrie-lambda-object



_[function]_         `CTRIE-LAMBDA-SPAWN  (SELF &KEY READ-ONLY)`

> Causes the atomic clone of enclosed ctrie structure and builds a new
  lexical closure to operate on it.  Does not bother to reproduce fancy
  (expensive) object, class, bindings, but provides almost identical
  functionality.  May be used to more efficintly distribute workload
  in parallel


_[macro]_            `DEFINE-CTRIE  (NAME CTRIE &REST ARGS &KEY (OBJECT T) SPEC)`

> Define a 'functional' __CTRIE-LAMBDA__ that combines all the the
  capabilities of the raw data structure with behavior and semantics
  one would expect of any other ordinary common-lisp function.  The
  resulting symbol defined as 'name will be bound in three distinct
  namespaces: the `SYMBOL-VALUE` will be bound to the LAMBDA CLOSURE
  object, `SYMBOL-FUNCTION` (fdefinition) will be FBOUND to the
  compiled function, and the corresponding '(SETF NAME) form will be
  SETF-BOUND.  the syntax for invoking NAME is as in a LISP1; i.e., no
  'funcall' is required (but still works if you prefer).
  Calling `(NAME key)` returns the value mapped to key, or `NIL` just
  as if by `(CTRIE-GET ctrie-name key).` Analogously when used as a
  setf-able place such as by `(setf (NAME key) value)` it has the
  equivalent behavior to the operation `(CTRIE-PUT ctrie-name key
  value).` Use of this type of binding technique has some really
  convenient effects that I've quickly started to become quite fond
  of.  One such idiom, for example, `(mapcar MY-CTRIE '(key1 key2 key3
  key4 ...))` returns a list containing all the mapped values
  corresponding to the respective keys.  One additional feature that
  I've found extremely useful is included _under the hood:_ Invoking
  MY-CTRIE on an object of type FUNCTION will not search the ctrie for
  an entry having that function ast its key, but will instead APPLY
  that function to the actual CTRIE structure wrapped within the
  closure.  Thus, `(MY-CTRIE #'identity)` will return the underlying
  ctrie as just an ordinary instance of a CTRIE STRUCTURE.  
  There are many other functions this is handy with, like
  `(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-size)` `(MY-CTRIE #'ctrie-to-hashtable)`
  etc.  Some additional examples are provided below.
