# Introduction

\**Clojure!*\*

For weeks, *months* &mdash; no! *from the very moment you were born*
&mdash; you've felt it calling to you. Every time you've held your
keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class
hierarchy; every time you've lain awake at night, disturbing your
loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a
race condition has caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling
hair, some secret part of you has known that *there has to be a better
way*.

Now, at long last, the web-based instructional material you have in
front of your face will unite you with the programming language you've
been longing for.

Are you ready, brave reader? Are you ready to meet your true destiny?
Grab your best pair of parentheses: you're about to embark on the
journey of a lifetime!

**The Four Labyrinths**

To wield Clojure to its fullest, you will need to find your way
through the four labyrinths confronting every programmer learning a
new language:

* **The Cave of Artifacts.** In its depths you'll learn to build, run,
  and distribute your own programs and use the libraries of others.
  You'll learn Clojure's relationship to the JVM.
* **The Forest of Tooling.** It's paramount to set up your environment
  so that you can quickly try things out and learn from them .
* **The Mountain of Language.** As you ascend, you'll gain knowledge
  of Clojure's syntax, semantics, and data structures.
* **The Cloud Castle of Mindset.** In its rarified air you will come
  to know the why and how of lisp, functional programming, and
  immutability.

Make no mistake: you *will* work. But together, we'll make the work
feel exhilirating, *not* exhausting. By the end, you'll be able to use
Clojure, one of the most exciting and fun programming languages in
existence.

## Part 1: Environment Setup

In order to stay motivated and learn efficiently, you need to be able
to actually try things out and build executables. No running code in a
browser for you!

### [Building, Running and the REPL](/getting-started/)

There's something powerful and motivating about getting a real program
running. Once you can do that, you're free to experiment and you can
actually share your work!

In this short chapter, you'll invest a small amount of time up front
to get familiar with a quick, problem-free way to build and run
Clojure programs. You'll also learn how to instantly experiment with
code within a running Clojure process using a REPL. This will tighten
your feedback loop, allowing you to learn more efficiently.

### [Using Emacs for Clojure development](/basic-emacs/)

Having a quick feedback loop for learning is so important that we
cover Emacs from the ground up so that you're guaranteed to have an
efficient Emacs/Clojure workflow.

## [Part 2: Language Fundamentals](/language-fundamentals-overview/)

The goal of this section is to provide you with a solid foundation on
which to continue learning Clojure. You'll start by learning how to
actually do things, and then take a step back to understand the
underlying concepts.

### [Do Things](/do-things/)

While you've undoubtedly heard of Clojure's awesome concurrency
support and other stupendous features, Clojure's most salient
characteristic is that it is a Lisp. We're going to explore this Lisp
core. And this core is comprised of two parts: functions and data.

### Clojure Alchemy: Reading, Evaluation, and Macros

In this chapter, we'll take a step back and describe the way that
Clojure works. This will give you the conceptual structure needed to
truly understand how Clojure works and how it's different from other,
non-lisp languages. With this structure in place, we'll introduce
the macro, one of the most powerful tools in existence.
