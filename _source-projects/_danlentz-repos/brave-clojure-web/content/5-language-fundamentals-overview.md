# Clojure Language Fundamentals Overview

The goal of this section is to provide you with a solid foundation on
which to continue learning Clojure.

First, you'll learn how to actually *do things* in Clojure: how to
structure data, how to manipulate data with functions, and how to
associate data and functions with names. You'll also start learning
how to think as a Lisp programmer. This will allow you to start
playing with the language and building things for fun to help solidify
your knowledge.

Next, you'll learn all about functional programming: what it is and
why it matters.

Then, you'll learn Clojure's underlying structure by explaining the
Clojure *reader* and *evaluation*. This will give you a crystal-clear
understanding of how Clojure programs work.

Finally, we'll build on our understanding of Clojure's underlying
structure by exploring *macros*, one of the most powerful tools in
programming.
