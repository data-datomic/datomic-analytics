(graph-datomic "datomic:mem://example")
;; pops up a swing UI
```

```clojure
(graph-datomic "datomic:mem://example" :save-as "the-schema.dot")
;; writes graphviz to file and pops up swing UI
```

```clojure
(graph-datomic "datomic:mem://example" :save-as "the-schema.dot" :no-display true)
;; does not pop up a display
```

## Plugin

In order to use it as a lein plugin you must list it as a dependency *and* as a plugin.

```clojure
; project.clj
(defproject your-project "x.x.x"
  :dependencies [[datomic-schema-grapher "0.0.1"]]
  :plugins [[datomic-schema-grapher "0.0.1"]])
```

then

```bash
lein graph-datomic <datomic:protocol://example>
```

Note that the lein plugin will not work for in memory databases.
Consider using the repl with in memory databases.

This project is still in the early stages of development.
The API is likely to change.
