# datomic layer

- automatically track all calls for a request, and present this info in the response
- interceptors

TIL that when you do a reverse lookup on a component entity you get the parent entity directly (not a set). so:

```
(:message/_user my-user) ;;=> #{{:db/id 123}}
(:message/_events event) ;;=> {:db/id 234}
```

The example above is interesting because it emphasises how useful it is to think about whether something is a component entity. In the case of that :message/user one, you could argue that the message is actually a component of the user (heuristic: if I delete the user I also want to delete the message AND only there is only 1 user per message)

From there, you get a very nice way to decide which direction to set up your attribute when you create schema, as there's now a good reason to say that it should be :user/messages rather than :message/user ; and since you get direct reverse lookup in component entities, perf is 100% preserved.
