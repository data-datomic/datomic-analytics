# Seamless SS calls w/ non-transit-able data
If a ss function is mean to be called with files, ArrayBuffers, blobs, etc., the call can happen as normal, but upon noticing that the type is non-transit-serializeable data, Dato should instead create store a local (temp) ref in an atom somewhere, tell the server that it intends to call a fn with this data (and its type), arrange to first upload the data to the server, and then call the function as a normal transit-able ss function. Maybe the server gives the client a token to use to upload the resource via a separate channel - the token would operate as both authorization of the upload and identification of the resource. Something similar might have to happen to get the data back to the client, but that seems more rare.
