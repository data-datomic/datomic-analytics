C API for r2
============

r2 is already written in C, so there's no need to provide bindings
for it, but it's true that sometimes r2 feels bloated or big and
many times you just want to use a small portion of r2 for your own
projects.

This directory aims to provide simple usage examples to build small
tools on top of the r2 apis and try to redesign the APIs to make
them easier to use for everybody.
