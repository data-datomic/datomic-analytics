Welcome to udis86's documentation!
==================================

Udis86 is a disassembler engine that interprets and decodes a 
stream of binary machine code bytes as opcodes defined in the 
x86 and x86-64 class of Instruction Set Archictures. The core 
component of this project is libudis86 which provides a clean 
and simple interface to disassemble binary code, and to inspect 
the disassembly to various degrees of detail. The library is 
designed to aid software projects that entail analysis and 
manipulation of all flavors of x86 binary code.
