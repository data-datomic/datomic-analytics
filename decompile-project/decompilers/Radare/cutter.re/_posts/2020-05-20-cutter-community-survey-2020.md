<p>The Cutter team is working hard to create a free and open-source reverse engineering framework that will give you the best RE experience. Our 2020 community survey is here and this is our opportunity to get to know you better.</p>

<p>We already interact with many of you frequently using Telegram, IRC, and Twitter, but the interactions tend to be about specific problems. We want to hear from all of you, all the way from those who found it too difficult to start with Cutter to those who have contributed several times. We want to hear what you love about Cutter and what you hate about it. We want to hear about your smallest annoyances and problems that may take 5 years to solve. Anything goes. It’s only with your help that we can make Cutter into a truly useful tool.</p>

<p>Please take a few minutes to fill the survey. We’ll collect responses for about a month and then we’ll publish the results on our blog, groups and social media.</p>
