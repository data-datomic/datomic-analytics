We have applied to be a mentoring organization for this yearâ€™s [Google Summer of Code]( http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015 ).

We recognize that GSoC is always a fierce competition, but we are, as ever, hopeful that we will join many other fine organizations in a great summer of hacking. If you are a student interested in applying, please head over to our [ideas page]( http://rada.re/gsoc ) and begin thinking about what you might like to hack on. Furthermore, we have several [low-hanging fruits]( https://github.com/radare/radare2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy ) if you want to play a bit with the codebase.

We already applied last year, but were rejected; maybe we'll make it this year. And if we don't, we'll do a [RSoC]( http://radare.today/the-rsoc-is-over/ ) again!
