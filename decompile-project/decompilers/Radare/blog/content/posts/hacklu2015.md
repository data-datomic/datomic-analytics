Like last year, some radare2 developers and contributors went to the
11th edition of the [hack.lu]( http://2015.hack.lu/ ), in Luxembourg,
to hold not one, but **two** 5 hours-long workshops!

- [maijin]( https://twitter.com/Maijin212) did the first part, about what is
radare2 and how to use it
- [jvoisin]( https://dustri.org ) did the second one, about how to write a nocd
for a classic game, and (based on the work of [NighterMan]( https://twitter.com/NighterMan),
also about how to unpack [shikata ga nai]( https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/encoders/x86/shikata_ga_nai.rb )
with [ESIL]( https://github.com/radare/radare2book/blob/master/esil.md ).
- [crowell]( https://twitter.com/jeffreycrowell) (whose ctf team,
[shellphish]( https://twitter.com/shellphish_ctf ) scored 4th worldwide, and **first** locally,
on the [hack.lu ctf]( http://2015.hack.lu/ctf/ ), likely thanks to their usage of radare2.) did
the third part, about how to pwn things and to pop shells!
- [xvilka]( https://twitter.com/akochkov ) finished the workshop with a top-notch part
about how to deal with firmwares using radare2.

Of course, we put the slides (and their sources, if you enjoy reading LateX)
and the materials [online]( https://github.com/XVilka/hacklu ) :)

Overall, it seems that people really enjoyed attending the workshop,
and we had a lot of interested questions to answer.
We look forward to add your name on the [radare2 user list]( http://radare.today/posts/who-uses-r2/ ),
and to answer your questions on [irc]( irc://irc.freenode.net/radare ).

Thanks to everyone who attended, and to the hack.lu staff for organizing such
a wonderful conference!
