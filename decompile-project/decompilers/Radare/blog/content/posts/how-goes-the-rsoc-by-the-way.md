Apart moving a bit slowly, it's going fine.

[Skia]( http://libskia.so/b/ ) is working on extending 'pf' command to improve display of nested structures, then will start to implement conditional structures, to lay the foundations of 010-templates-like support.

[jfrankowski]( http://failhard.org/ ) is improving the YARA support, and will likely greatly enhance the zignature feature.

[fr33tux]( http://fr33tux.org ) is working on sdb, but it seems that he has lost his internet connection.

Things are moving slowly, but students seems to be interested by their tasks, and we're doing the best to mentor them. Please keep in mind that they are not fluent in C, and are still learning.
