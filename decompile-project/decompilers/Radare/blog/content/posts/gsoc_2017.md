Good news everyone!

Gather round, we've got incredible good news for everyone!

We're happy to announce that we're (again) accepted for the [Google Summer of
Code]( https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ )! For this occasion, we
wrote a [fancy website](http://rada.re/gsoc/2017/) with everyone you have to
know to participate: mentors, ideas, contacts, protips, micro-tasks, …

During the last years, students implemented interesting features, like
structures support, a better analysis engine, … we're looking forward to see
what _you_ are going to implement next ;)

The student application period opens in 10 days, and ends the 3rd of April,
so hurry up!
