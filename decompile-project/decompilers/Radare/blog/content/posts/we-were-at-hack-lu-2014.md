[Hack.lu]( http://hack.lu ) was a really great 4 day long convention in Luxembourg, organised by the [CIRCL]( http://www.circl.lu ), where we ([jvoisin]( http://dustri.org/b/hacklu-2014.html ), [maijin]( http://maijin.fr )
and [xvilka]( http://xvilka.me )) did *two* 6h-long workshops about radare2 wit in front of a crowed room. In total more than 60 people attended!

At first, we didn't expected much people and planned only one workshop. But we ended up refusing people and doing a second one the day after!

Maijin did the first part, dedicated to reversing and actually using radare2, jvosin the second one about exploitation, and xvilka did the last one; about reversing and analysing firmwares.

According to [twitter]( https://twitter.com/hashtag/radare2?src=hash ) it seems that overall, people enjoyed it. The slides and practical materials should appear on the [radare blog]( http://bin.radare.today/ ) and on the [hack.lu archive]( http://archive.hack.lu/2014/ ).

The organisation was kind enought to let us do a lighting talk in front of the whole assembly right before the second workshop.

It's worth noticing that a lot of speakers mentionned radare2 in their talks; we're getting famous!

To sum up, we spent a lot of time teaching how to use radare2, did a lighting talk and spent 4 days eating amazing food!
