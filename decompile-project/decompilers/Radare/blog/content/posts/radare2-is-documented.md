Some *miscreants* are saying that radare2 is not documented, this is wrong.

# The Book

The "radare book" was released together with radare 1.0, several years ago, so some of the examples/features may not be compatible with radare2.

You can read it [online]( http://radare.org/doc/html/contents.html ) or download the [PDF]( http://radare.org/get/radare.pdf ).

Recently, our tester in chief, maijin, started a project to update the radare book to create the [radare2 book](http://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/); feel free to contribute.

A book focused on practical case by monosource is also available : [radare2-explorations](https://monosource.gitbooks.io/radare2-explorations/content/)

# The API

The radare2 api (aka [libr]( https://github.com/radare/radare2/tree/master/libr )) is described in [vapi]( https://github.com/radare/radare2-bindings/tree/master/vapi) files. Those files are translated by [valaswig]( https://github.com/radare/valabind ) into swig interface files to generate the bindings for python, ruby, perl and others.

Those [Vala]( http://live.gnome.org/Vala ) vapi files are at the same time parsed by [Valadoc]( http://live.gnome.org/Valadoc ) to generate the [online]( http://radare.org/vdoc ) documentation.
