One of our [resident developers]( https://github.com/radare/radare2/graphs/contributors ) (xvilka) was at PHDays to do a talk (A [fast-track]( http://www.phdays.com/program/fast-track/37841/ ) one):

 >Application of Radare2 Illustrated by Shylock and Snakso.A Analysis
 
> The speaker will present his experience of applying Radare2 â€” an open-source reverse engineering tool, and illustrate it by the examples of the Windows trojan Shylock and 64-bit Linux malware Snakso.A. The techniques of analysis include both statistical disassembling of the code and its debugging with Radare2.

The fact that radare2 is currently having a massive refactoring of one its low-layer component added some fun, since we fixed bug until a couple of hours before the talk.

We initially wanted to show that radare2 is a reliable tool to reverse malwares, but since the presentation has to fit in 15 minutes, malwares turned into a pretext to showcase features.
