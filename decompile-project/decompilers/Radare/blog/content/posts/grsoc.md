![RSoC](http://bin.radare.today/rsoc.png)
We've got two pieces of good news for you; the first one is that our [RSoC]( http://rada.re/r/rsoc.html ) is now live! The second is a bit surprising: we've got a GSoC slot!

# GSoC
Thanks to [solar designer]( https://twitter.com/solardiz ) who offered us to be part of the GSoC, under the umbrella of the [Openwall]( http://www.openwall.org/ ) project, we've got a slot for a single student to work on radare2 for a couple of months, while being payed $5,500! This is truly amazing, and we're super-grateful to Openwall and solardiz for this: Thank you very much!
Application are starting the 16th of March, and are last until the 27th, so hurry up!

# RSoC
Since our [last RSoC]( http://radare.today/the-rsoc-is-over/ ) was a success, we decided to host a second one despite our surprise-acceptance in the GSoC.
The schedule for the RSoC is:

  - **March 11**: Begin applications
  - **May 3**: End of application acceptance
  - **May 8**: Announce of the selected students
  - **June 17**: Start coding!
  - **Sept 16**: "Pencils down"
  - **Sept 27**: Code must be merged into radare2 repo
  
Like last year, everyone can apply; you don't need to be a student. If you want to write some code, you're more than welcome.
Unfortunately, to make it happen we need some money, so we're holding a [donation campaign]( http://rada.re/r/rsoc.html ), with the goal of raising 3000 EUR to pay our participants.

You can give us your [bitcoins]( bitcoin:1R4daREx3gYpYJ87KqWRahzFHVfZMQVBi?message=donation ), or use Paypal if you prefer.
(Please notice that for legal reasons, the Paypal account is owned by [jvoisin]( http://dustri.org ),
one of the core contributors, since the r2 project doesn't have a legal entity to represent itself yet.)
