Hell yeah!
We're accepted in the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/), again!
Hurry hurry, [pick (or propose) a task](http://rada.re/gsoc/2018/), and spend
the summer with us, improving radare2! Analysis, decompilation, GUI,
portability, … you name it.

During the previous years, students implemented awesome features (analysis,
structure support, windows-related improvements, …). What are **you** going to
implement next?

The applications are ending the 27th of March, so hurry up, we're waiting for
you ♥
