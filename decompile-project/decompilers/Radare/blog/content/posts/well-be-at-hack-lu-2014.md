We are accepted at [hack.lu]( https://hack.lu/ ), both for a [talk]( http://2014.hack.lu/index.php/Agenda ) and a [workshop]( https://twitter.com/hack_lu/status/499974646306205696 ): three of our contributors ([jvoisin](http://dustri.org), [maijin]( http://maijin.fr/ ) and [xvilka]( https://github.com/XVilka )) will be in Luxembourg to spread to good word about radare2! 

# Talk
If you don't know radare2 yet, make sure to attend the talk, since it will explain what it is, why a tool like this is needed, and some examples about what it's possible to achieve with it: exploitation, firmwares, malwares analysis, ...

# Workshop
If you already know radare2 (or attended the talk) and wish to know more about it and get your hands dirty, we'll be happy to show you some black-magic at the workshop! Feel also free to send us emails or brag on [irc]( irc://freenode.net/radare ) about what you wish to see/learn during this event.

See you in there ;)
