Special thanks from pancake to:

* [@revskills](https://twitter.com/revskills) for the massive fuzzing
* [Google](http://radare.org/gsoc) for the GSoC
* [Ghostbar](https://twitter.com/ghostbar) for being the new Debian maintainer and update r2 packages
* [Nibble](https://twitter.com/nibble_ds) for coming back
* [Alvaro Felipe Melchor]( https://alvarofe.github.io/ ) for the elf relocs, dyldcache and the massive bugfixing.
* oddcoder for being the most active student
* Daniel Dominguez for the initial coredump support

This release is much bigger than we ever thought. Thanks to Google and GSoC applications process we've got an honest amount of a students' contributions, who implemented a few file formats, improved analysis and fixed a bunch of issues. 

Highlights
----------

- Add `r2 -d` and `-R` shortcuts to simplify loading rarun2 profiles and using remote debugging plugins
- Support for cryptography (blowfish, rc2, rc4, aes, xor, ror, rol)
  - `woE`/`woD`
  - `rabin2 -E`
  - Adding `wo*y` commands using clipboard instead of [val]
- Better PE and ELF parsers
- New easter-egg!
- dyldcache extractor is working again
- Support for [BOCHS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochs )
- [Coredump]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump ) support for iOS and OSX
- New fileformats, namely Python bytecode and Flash files
- Improved analysis and emulation thanks to ESIL on x86, ARM and MIPS
- New `make menu` to choose plugins to build
- Add `?E` clippy echo and use it in ????
- xrefs and types are now properly saved/restored from projects

New R2PM packages
-----------------
- ramoji2
- www-t and www-p
- syms2elf

Better Disassembly
------------------
- Add `asm.spacy` and `asm.flgoff`
- *noreturn* function database is much more reliable now
- Summary mode (`pds`)
- Press `R` in visual to rotate on the color themes. (see `scr.randpal`)
- Fix some `asm.spacy` and `asm.flgoff` glitches
- Add `ecn` and use it from VR with `scr.randpal`
- `asm.fcnsign` is now working for non-windows binaries
- `asm.(symbol|section)[.col]`
- Added m68k parse pseudo plugin and enhance the arm one
- Fix ROR/ROL ESIL expressions for x86-64 capstone
- Honor `fcn.fcnlines` in fcnvarlist

WebUI
-----
- WebUI moved to a separate repository.
- some of them accessible via r2pm (`r2pm -i www-t www-m`)
- use [Grunt]( http://gruntjs.com/ ), update all dependencies, indent code, minify, ..
- Fixed some XSS vulns
- Added `http.referer` checks to fix CSRF vuln

Architectures
------------
- z80: better analysis
- SNES: better analysis too and support 16-bit immediate operands
- m68k: fixed bugs and improved analysis. honor asm.cpu
- ARM (better analysis and emulation, handle IT)
  - Honor ARM conditional bits to skip bxeq lr and such
  - Better Thumb support
  - Assemble `blx` for arm32 and thumb
- New plugins!
  - Adding initial support for PIC18C diassembler

- Add graph.gv variables to set custom graphviz styles
- Fix #4374 - ags command to show simplified flowgraph


Bindiffing
----------
- `radiff2 -C` does not analyze by default, mimics `r2 -A`
- Does not diff strings because they are not functions
- Increase memory limit for code diffing

Analysis
--------

- Fix `aap` for static and make it work in debugger
- Find more string references for MIPS and remove some false positives.
- ROP search find honor search.align and detects more cases
- Do not autoname functions by default. Add e anal.autoname
- analysis is deeper than ever: new `aaaa` command
- `aai` command to show analysis statistics info
- `aav` command to show all references for section/map
- added lodsb,stosb and did some rep cosmetic to esil x86
