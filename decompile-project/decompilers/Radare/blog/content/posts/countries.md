It seems that xvilka's [post]( http://habrahabr.ru/post/218969/ ) on habrahabr attracted many peoples, then comes reddit and [twitter]( https://twitter.com/radareorg ). The lobbying on [stackexchange]( https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/radare2 ) is starting to pay.

Most people are landing on the main page, and the second most viewed is the [crowfunding]( http://rada.re/y/?p=cowfunding ) one.

Unsurprisingly, our main visitor base is from Russia and USA. Followed by France, Germany and Spain. This is also where the main contributors are currently living; it seems that radare2 is contagious!
