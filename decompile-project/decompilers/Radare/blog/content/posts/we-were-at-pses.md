One of our resident contributor ([jvoisin]( http://dustri.org/b/pses-2014.html )) was at PSES to do a talk in French, entitled *Rétro-ingénierie avec radare2 - Parce que l'assembleur, c'est sympathique*, aka *Reversing with radare2 - Because assembly is sympathetic*. 

If you're interested in french terms (some of them are funny), you can watch the whole talk on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrR2Bcyheu4), and download the slides [here]( http://radare.org/y/t/pses2014/pses2014_radare2.pdf )

Since the audience was non-technical, the first part is a gentle introduction to reverse engineering, and the second one is composed of two (messies) demos of radare2 in action for a [WAP54G]( http://support.linksys.com/en-us/support/accesspoints/WAP54G ) pwnage, and also a quick and dirty crack for an [old game]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrowind ).

Overall, people liked the talk, and we likely gained some new contributors.
