We're the 8th of May, and as [planned]( http://rada.re/rsoc/ ), this is the day we announce the selected applicants/tasks.

## Money

Thanks to the crowfunding, we managed to get a fair amount of money, less than we hoped, but it's still nice.

- Euros: 1347 EUR
- Bitcoin: 0.45 BTC
- Dogecoins: 123935 XDG

We didn't managed to get *corporate* sponsors. Hopefully, since the project is gaining momentum, we'll be able to get some for next year!

## Applicants

We selected two applicants, and we'll give them $1000 each if they complete their tasks. We would have been delighted to pay everyone, but we can't. We decided to give money to people that are needing money, and that who are working on prioritary tasks.

We'd like to say thanks to the other applicants for several reasons:

1. Thank you for applying. This is our first RSoC, and we're a small project: thank you very much for believing in us.
2. Some of you said that they don't care about the money: they'll do a RSoC even if they are not payed. We'll be *super-happy* to help you getting code into radare2!

## Goodies
We may not be able to pay you all, however, we'll send you a T-Shirt and some stickers anyway!

## Selected people
*pancake*, *jvoisin*, *dso* and *xvilka* voted, and selected the following people:

- **[fr33tux]( http://fr33tux.org )**, for enhancing [sdb]( https://github.com/radare/sdb ), and integrating it more deeply in radare2.
- **[zakharvoit]( https://github.com/zakharvoit )**, for implementing Python bytecode support and refining/improving python bindings (ctypes based).

Also, a lot a people applied, and when we said that we would not manage to accept everyone, some of them declined the monetary retribution.

Here are the **open develop groups**:

- **inisider** (with PDB/WinDbg task)
- **alex_x86** and **dukebarman** (with WebUI task)
- **Hyask** (with Templates task)
