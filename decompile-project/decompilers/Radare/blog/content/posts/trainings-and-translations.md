The summer is almost over and everyone is back to the main loop.

Some of us will be in Oct 21-24 at hack.lu giving a talk and a workshop. See http://radare.today/well-be-at-hack-lu-2014/

But pancake (aka Sergi Ã€lvarez), the author and main contributor to the project will be busy giving two trainings in spanish:


Navajas Negras 2014
--------------
He'll be there on October 2, 3, 4. Giving a free and libre 2h introductory workshop to r2 for reverse engineering.

For more information about the congress, entrance prices and transport check it at http://navajanegra.com/

Securizame course
----------
In addition to this workshop, there will be an online course under the title "Curso de Reversing y Exploiting Avanzado en Windows y Linux". Where pancake will be teaching part of the introduction and the linux-reversing part.

The course will be online via the Webex platform and it is composed of different modules:

* Introduction
* Windows
  * Reversing
  * Exploiting
* Linux
  * Reversing
  * Exploiting
  
As far as we know, there will be several use cases of r2 in the introduction and Linux reversing and exploiting modules. And probably some for windows, so if you know spanish and want to learn reverse engineering, exploiting or just get in touch with practical sessions of radare. This is your course!

**NOTE** September 15 is the last day for signing up on that training.

The book
------
The original book (radare1) was already reviewed and updated by maijin to be in sync with the very latest r2 versions.

After the update, we are now publishing the first translation of it, in Persian. Thanks to Mohsen Mostafa Jokar.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radare/radare2book/master/translations/radare2book-persian.pdf

The book is still incomplete and should require more reviews, contributions and translations. But it's written in markdown and hosted in github, so we wait for your additions, comments, etc!
