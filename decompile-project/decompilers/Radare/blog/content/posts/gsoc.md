Attention, people of the internet!

Gather round, we've got incredible good news for everyone!

We're incredibly happy to announce the acceptance of two students for the [Google Summer of Code 2015]( https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015 ):

**[David Kreuter]( https://twitter.com/dkreuter_ )** and **[Sushant Dinesh]( https://sushant94.github.io/ )**. 

Both students have already completed complex tasks, just as a qualification: an ESIL implementation for the 8051 architecture, and an ESIL-to-REIL converter.

We hope that they'll continue hard work at the same tempo and will make decompilation for radare2 much better Hex-Rays' decompiler.

Thank you Google for organizing this, and to [OpenWall]( http://openwall.com ) for giving us two slots!
