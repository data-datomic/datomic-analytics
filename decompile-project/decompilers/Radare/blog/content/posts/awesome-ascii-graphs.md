The graph feature of IDA, ImmunityDBG or Hopper are great to have a quick overview of what you're dealing with. This is why we have graphs too in radare2, but since we're terminal-lovers, ours are ~~cooler~~ in ASCII!

After analyzing a function with `af` or any other method, type `VV` to get:
![functions graphs](/blog/images/BmWvHyyIcAAoIfo-png-large.png)

We've got call graphs, which are way more understandable than simply listing the XREF adresses. To see it, simply press `V` when you're in graph mode.

Unfortunately, the classic *80x24* terminal size is not that convenient when it comes to having an overview of a big function. This is why we also have `VVn`, to show a *mini-graph*.

On the left, you can see the code of the current node (The one with `@@` on it. You can switch nodes with `<tab>`). The `t` branche stands for *true* and `f` for *false*.

Every graph is interactive: you can move their nodes around, walk them (`t`,`f`,`u`), show bytes/flags (`O`), debug within them (`z`/`Z`), jump around xrefs (`x`/`X`), â€¦

To scroll the RConsCanvas use the `asdw` keys. The `hjkl` ones are used for moving the nodes around. Also bear in mind that ASDW and HJKL will do the same as the lowercase ones, but *faster!*

And of course, it's documented, with `?`

If you think that we're missing your favourite type of graph, feel free to come rant about this on [irc]( irc://irc.freenode.net/radare ) ;)

There's also three different graphs implementations in the WebUI, which works fine with touchscreens, but its still not perfect, you can check the default one by pressing `space` in the disasm view of `r2 -c=H /bin/ls`

Ho, and speaking of graph, tracing information from the debugger or the esil emulation is now displayed in the [web interface]( http://cloud.radare.org/p )!

Future plans for graphs are:

* Better layout (no more overlapping nodes)
* Support Colors
* Support UTF-8
* Group nodes
* Add comments in nodes
* Save/Restore graph states (wip in the webui)
* Print graph to file
* Generic API and commandline tool to create graphs like `dot` does.
* Better WebUI graphs

If you want to do any of those things feel free to checkout the code `libr/core/graph.c`.
