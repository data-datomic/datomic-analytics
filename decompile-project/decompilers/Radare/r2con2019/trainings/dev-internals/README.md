==============================

--pancake

Learning how to fix bugs, add new features, write plugins or modify the behaviour of any command in r2 by modifying its source is a very important task for any hacker, not just to make it work in the way you like but also to understand better the internals and small details.

The knowledge adquired in the training can be applied to other opensource projects, so it is interesting not just to anybody that wants to contribute to the project, but also for those who want to learn better good coding practices in C.
