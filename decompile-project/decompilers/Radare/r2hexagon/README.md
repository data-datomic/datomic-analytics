# Overview

This is a Hexagon disassembly and analysis plugin generator for radare2.
It uses text file of the specification as a source (recognized from PDF file),
and some additional text files with some amendments.

It processes the files and generate C code in `r2` directory. Just run `importer.py`.

The parsing part based largely on [hexag00n](https://github.com/programa-stic/hexag00n) importer.
