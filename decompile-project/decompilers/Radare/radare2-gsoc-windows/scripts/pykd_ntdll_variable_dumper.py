Was going to write this in pure .wds but decided against it for multiple
reasons.  This is a rough crap implementation and will probably never be
improved as the goal is to get r2 to do all of the work with the help of
r2pipe.

Installation:
    1. Install python2 (because 3 does not work well :'( )
    2. Install pykd
    3. (Optional) Update pykd in WinDbg: !pykd.pip install --upgrade pykd

Usage:
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\windbg.exe" -z "C:\Windows\System32\ntdll.dll"
    .load pykd
    !py script.py output_dir

        continue

    # Strip WinDbg's stupid info message
    if "dtx is unsupported for this scenario" in dump:
        dump = "".join(dump.split('\n', 1)[1:])
